# Where Am I? (What3Words version)

- who: This app is for developers to show off a poc. It's also for lost travelers.
- what: The app lets them their three-word location, shareable via https://what3words.com.
- so what: What3Words is an international, precise, and succinct locator. I think it's pretty cool using basic geolocation in the webpage.
